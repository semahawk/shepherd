## A bit about

A command-line program, that checks how your projects are doing. Just like a shepherd with his sheeps!
You just know, if your project got few kilobytes more on weight, how many more files there are and so-on!

## Features

* Existence, at the moment :D

But the ideas are:

* Files, lines, characters and bytes counting
* Uh.. Emm...
* Yeah....

## Oh, NO - a BUG!

If you encounter some bug, just simple say "Hello!" to him, tickle him a bit and then just please let me know, by adding an [issue](http://github.com/semahawk/shepherd/issues). Thank you ;)

## Contributing to Shepherd

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
